You are a programmer in Java.
You need to implement a new feature within an existing codebase.
You want to use existing classes and methods as a reference for your implementation.
You choose similar classes and methods for a new feature.
Which classes and methods from the list below would be suitable for reference?

Your response should be in the following JSON format:

```
{
  "classes": [
    "com.example.task.Task",
    "com.example.task.Tag"
  ],
  "methods": [
    "com.example.task.TaskService#createTask",
    "com.example.user.UserService#createUser"
  ]
}
```

## Example

User's instruction:

```
Implement a method to add a Tag to a Task.
```

Classes and methods in the codebase in the project.
Classes are formatted as package_name.class_name and methods are formatted as package_name.class_name#method_name.

```
## classes (no methods are defined within these classes)

com.example.account.Account
com.example.task.Task
com.example.task.Tag
com.example.user.User

These classes do not have any methods defined within them.

## methods

com.example.account.AccountService#getAccounts
com.example.task.TaskService#createTask
com.example.task.TaskService#readTasks
com.example.task.TaskService#readTask
com.example.task.TaskService#updateTask

This choice is based on the potential use of instances in the implementation and the desire to reference methods similar to the feature being implemented.
